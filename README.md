This was possibly the hardest block of code to commit. 
While trying to commit my work, I lost it somehow.
That is why you'll notice a lot of text.
I went through a long process of finding the dangling trees and pulling them out to be able to recover most of my work.
"git --fsck-lost" saved my life

# restore_files.sh 
I could not properly use that code to find my code.
I decided to keep it so that I can be able to refer to it later, should I need it.
